#summary running CORE on Linux

= Distribution Notes =

== Debian-based ==
=== Ubuntu 10.04 ===
 * Some kernel versions do not have namespace support turned on. With 2.6.32-32 kernel, you may get the vnoded error: `nsfork() failed: Invalid argument`
=== Ubuntu 10.10 ===
=== Ubuntu 11.04 ===
=== Ubuntu 11.10 ===

== Redhat-based ==
=== Fedora 13 ===
=== Fedora 14 ===
=== Fedora 15 ===
 * Set `SELINUX=permissive` in `/etc/sysconfig/selinux`. If you set `SELINUX=disabled` you'll also want to add `selinux=0` to your kernel line in `/etc/grub.conf`.
 * Turn off SELinux sandbox using `chkconfig sandbox off` and rebooting. Sandbox interferes with CORE's bind mounts, and all nodes will appear to have the same mounts (regardless of namespace). The output of "mount" will be lengthy and confusing.
 * Update to the 2.6.40.3-0.fc15.x86_64 (or newer) kernel using yum: "yum update kernel". The 2.6.38.6-26.rc1.fc15.x86_64 appears to have an IPv6 multicast checksum bug (see [NamespaceKernels])
=== Fedora 16 ===
== Other ==
=== OpenSUSE 11.3 ===
=== OpenSUSE 11.4 ===
=== Arch Linux ===
 * Users have provided these tips:<br>Here are the packages required for Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S bridge-utils ebtables, iproute, libev, tcl, tk, tkimg, python, xterm, lxc, autoconf, automake, make, libtool, readline, xauth`<br> ebtables, lxc, and tkimg are only available through aur.archlinux.org.<br>A user-made AUR package for CORE: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=42250
