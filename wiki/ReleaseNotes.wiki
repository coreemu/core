*Known Issues with 4.7*
 * Bandwidth plots and Throughput Widget broken in CORE 4.7. See bug #257. You can apply the one-line fix using: 
{{{
sudo sed -i 's/set ifname "n\$node_num\\\\.\$ifname/set ifname "veth\$node_num\\\\.[string range \$ifname 3 end]/' /usr/lib/core/widget.tcl
}}}
 * Under Fedora or CentOS Linux, the repository version of Quagga (`yum install quagga`) does not work with CORE. See bug #255. You need to build Quagga or Quagga MDR from source using the [http://downloads.pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/docs/core/core-html/install.html#compiling-quagga-for-core manual instructions] or use the [http://downloads.pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ospf-manet/ fc16 Quagga MDR package] (works with fc20).
 * Under Fedora or CentOS Linux, NetworkManager will automatically invoke DHCP clients on CORE-generated interfaces. See bug #253. Ubuntu ignores interfaces having the "veth" prefix. Recommended workaround is to turn off NetworkManager using:
{{{
systemctl stop NetworkManager
systemctl disable NetworkManager
}}}

Known issues with 4.3
 * CORE will segfault under Ubuntu 11.10 with Tcl/Tk 8.5.10. There is a known bug in the tk-8.5.10 package, the workaround is to uninstall it and install tk-8.5.11 from [http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/tk8.5 here]; see [http://code.google.com/p/coreemu/issues/detail?id=90 bug #90]
 * the libimg-1.2.4_8 port under FreeBSD 9.0 causes icons in the CORE GUI to appear in black; there is an error showing gif files; see [http://code.google.com/p/coreemu/issues/detail?id=108 bug #108]
 * the vcore-4.3.zip (md5sum: b10758ede92db7fa8cf1fa6537d88fbb) had a problem where the UUID listed in the VirtualBox XML did not match the vmdk disk file. This was corrected on 3/26/12 (md5sum: 2282036b2cd6416159c70165e824c36d). An old vmdk disk file was used having CORE 4.2 instead of 4.3; this was corrected on 4/2/12 (md5sum: 5d85dc5da5f12f98206905ff772c48f3)
 * CORE 4.3 fails to build under Ubuntu 12.04 due to changes in the Linux 3.2.x include files; this was fixed in r429, so you can use the development snapshot when using a newer distro.

Known issues with 4.2:
 * the CORE 4.2 source tarball fails to build on Fedora. <br>Fix this by changing this line in configure.ac: `AC_SUBST(libev_CFLAGS,)` to `AC_SUBST(libev_CFLAGS, [-I/usr/include/libev])`<br>This was due to an attempt to remove pkg-config as a dependency, but has been fixed in SVN and newer.
 * Fedora 15 does not add the hostname to the 127.0.0.1 localhost line of the `/etc/hosts` file, which causes CORE to print an error: "couldn't open socket: can't assign requested address" when the execute button is pressed.
 * [http://code.google.com/p/coreemu/issues/detail?id=39 issue 39] OSPF hellos become synchronized after 1 hr of running
