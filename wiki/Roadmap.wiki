#summary CORE development roadmap

This page lists planned development milestones.

= Plans for 2012 =

== Robustness and Usability Enhancements == 
 * Testing framework and exception system
  * improved support for raising CEL exceptions
  * kernel/system tests
 * Service configuration
  * improved node service customization
  * storing/applying frequently-used configurations
 * Further develop Python scripting examples and documentation
  * clearer tutorial on writing CORE Python scripts
 * Greater control of interface/link configuration
  * install physical interface into namespace
  * expose tc queuing disciplines for power users

== NRL Network Modeling Framework (NMF) Integration ==
 * Goal is to support a well-defined experiment workflow
 * Read and write XML file formats
 * Re-use of NMF tools/scripts where applicable
 * Use Motion Planning Framework (MPF) tools for node mobility
  * currently the user supplies their own ns-2/scengen file
 * provide SDT 3D output
  * one click from 2D GUI to launch 3D GUI
 * Physical Nodes
  * improved managing, assigning, monitoring
  * EMANE support for physical nodes
  * physical interfaces

== Co-Emulation/Simulation Integration ==
 * Xen
  * generalize and merge xen branch into trunk
   * support non-ISO-based filesystems
   * support node services, EMANE
 * EMANE
  * save/load model presets (e.g. RF-PIPE "SATCOM" preset)
  * interoperability with new models/versions
  * improve health monitoring and control mechanisms
 * ns-3
  * integrate node location
  * GUI-based configuration and control of ns-3
   * purely ns-3 simulated nodes
  * update CORE to have channel reference devices
